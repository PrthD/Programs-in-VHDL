VHDL Character Display for Xilinx Zybo Board

Welcome to the VHDL Character Display repository designed for the Xilinx Zybo development board. This repository contains a VHDL program that enables you to display characters on the Zybo board's display.

The Xilinx Zybo board is a powerful platform for embedded system development, featuring a Xilinx Zynq-7000 system-on-chip (SoC) with an FPGA fabric. This repository provides a VHDL program that leverages the Zybo board's capabilities to display characters on the onboard display. Whether you want to create custom text displays, simple games, or interactive applications, this program serves as a foundation for your projects.
